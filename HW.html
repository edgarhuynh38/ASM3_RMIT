<p> <b> • Facts: </b> I like IT programming, and study front end back end.
</p>
<p> <b> • IT interest: </b> My brother is the one who inspired me to follow the IT patch. I said that because anytime I saw him on the computer, his fingers  surfed on the keyboard so fast that I couldn't even recognize what he was trying to type. Each line of code he types on the computer makes me wonder what he is going to create with those lines. Suddenly, he shows me that if any spam email or malware wants to enter our PC system, it will immediately remove the harmful material. From that moment, I feel that IT will be my future career where I could develop software that protects others' private information against those hackers who try to steal bank accounts, and customer data. Moreover, I have participated in a robotics coding competition 2 years ago which my team earned second place overall. This powerful experience I gained was really helpful with the major I currently study in Rmit. I have taken one more step closer to become a skillful software developer. Although I still need to put more effort into it, I will try my best.

<h2>Group processes</h2>
<h2>Career Plans</h2>
<p> For us, there is a lot in common when it comes to Ideal Work. Examples: what all knowledge members have in common using IT skills such as coding, experience with all programming languages ​​and soft skills such as communication. Thinh chose to work as an embedded software engineer while others chose to work in different fields such as working for Apple, Software Engineering and Game Creation. An ideal job for entertainment is games, which require difficult areas in the IT industry, and Tuan chose to work in Apple's platform-based development. Beside Cheng choose to become a software engineering which I required to study more coding languages ​​as well as understand deeply about the technology. However, although everyone in the group has different directions, all the ideal jobs of the group have some similarities as we all work with IT systems and PC software, jobs. This requires general skills and job experience that can develop during the job.

<h1> Project Description </h1>

<h2> Over View </h2>
<p> Topic:
Our project idea is about programming an AI to support family life. Therefore, after carefully considering what our AI could and willing to do, we decided to create an AI that could be used as protection against criminals and threats, control the light and air conditioning systems in order to decrease the wasteful use of energy , and look after the babies. Besides that, we want to introduce to Vietnamese citizens about new technology which they can save as much money as they want if they understand our ideas and want to apply AI into their own house. Our ideas also base on the global warming issues as people continuously waste a lot of energy per second, and the programme that is being created will minimize the impact on the environment.

The team looks forward to having a friendly, convenient, and useful system to operate your house efficiently as well as your daily task. Our AI can serve your essential needs and wants while you are having a headache because of work pressure. Consequently, our AI definitely guarantees to help you have a happy life in your lovely home. Furthermore, it is important for you to give us some feedback on our idea and we can generate your advice into our product to make it look perfect.
 </p>
 <br>
 <p>
  Motivation:
  If someone asks me about where I get the idea and why I am passionate about AI, I will always say that I want to make human life more easy and secure. To be honest, this modern world pushes people to their limit especially at work, they don’t have time to take care of their family members as well as their lovely house. Furthermore, our team want residents to be safe from any kind of threats such as electric shock, sexual harassment, and murderer. Besides that, we also consider a solution to reduce the amount of heat that has been released by the air conditioners into the environment. If this is successfully built, the society must give a great applause to us because we can decrease the heat that causes global warming to become seriously dangerous, the alarm system about strangers entering the house, and look after kids from getting electric shock.

 <br>
 <p>Landscape:
  From the research about the market of this type of product, there are some companies that already did the similar product and they have used the same technologies like our group project. Most smart home companies are from the US such as Google LLC, Amazon, ABB ltd from Switzerland, LG from South Korea. Moreover, ZigBee, Z-Wave, Lutron, and Wink are needed in designing a smart house. I found that there are two huge advantages that smart house companies currently consider on IOT and program working as same as a computer, in other words it could fall and attack by hackers. Because of the reasons that have been mentioned, we strongly believe that the new AI can successfully overcome the problems that the old one suffer from and we the next generation will observe the latest technology that give us the possibility to make most of the benefits for the nation, our beloved country Vietnam.

<h2> Detailed Description </h2>
<h3> Aims </h3>
<p> Cheng section: </p>
<h3> Plans and Progress </h3>
<p> As for my team's idea, we have developed the convenience of future smart homes and specifically suit the current situation in Vietnam. And we have been moving towards AI technology, which is suitable for the smart house system and we plan to develop it in Vietnam first and if it is successfully operated, we can ask the Make a contribution so that we can publicize the technology world. On the other hand, we encountered some difficulties in making this project a reality. The members' knowledge is limited in this area as well as the current technology does not allow us to realize our projects. We have divided the specifics of this project and here are the details of each individual in our team about this project.
 </p>
 <p> On the one hand, the concept part of the project, which everyone on the team thought it would be difficult because the knowledge in this area seemed to be our biggest challenge. We discussed a lot about how to get practical ideas for the smart home project. Our original intention was just a smart home that could be controlled by devices as far away as a phone. But things changed as we learned more about other serious issues such as today's worldwide kidnapping situation. We have searched the above information through reputable journalists and this is one of them
 </p>
 <li> <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/196465.pdf"> Click here to see my research.
 </a> </li>
 <p> We have already embarked on a search to develop the project. We have divided into 3 main jobs that are to learn about technologies to be able to build a smart home. For instance, we looked at AI technology. Moreover, we also learned about Azure Machine Learning's specific features. It is the encompassing of services and functions related to AI sub-fabrication. Some of our project's AI security systems and related industry features.
</p>
<p>  The second job is to try to figure out how to apply those technologies without our idea of ​​"reminder" to work smoothly. Furthermore, we have already tested these technologies, the testing has proceeded into four phases of virtual testing, prototype testing, real field testing, and final testing. In the first phase, we need to test the software online to see if all functions are working correctly, we will use the code checking software to run all the code we created. for AI and debug any minor or core problems. The next stage, we create a prototype of the product with a simple modem and try to connect it to our on-premises Internet modem, try using the app and control the house with the prototype, AI will be used at 4 members' homes. of the group for a month to realize how it works differently from another Internet access. The next step, we will try the volunteer AI at home for at least 1 month to see what the problem could be and how to improve the functions, the volunteer will be gathered from a post on the website. and give them the opportunity to test AI for the first month and 3 months for free to receive gifts, the project needs to get as much feedback as possible so the team will try to find at least 20 AI users at their facility. The final test is the product sales period for the first year, so if anyone tries to buy an AI product in its first year on the market, the team will give them the first 10 days free to use the function. demo function of the device, in the first 10 days if any problem occurs, we will give the customer a new one and make sure the new one works as their needs. We will discuss the results of any test phase and compare all 4 stages with each other, so if the first stage the machine works normally but it is different from the second stage we there will be a discussion and try to figure out the cause of the difference and when should we fix the problems, until all stages release the same or better results, We will confirm that this AI is ready for sale.
</p>
<p> And the third job is to learn about people's information as well as data to be able to give out specific figures for the adjustment. For instance, we opened a survey of people's opinions about the disadvantages of existing smart homes in smart homes today. And the result that we get the most is the lack of specific calculation of the current smart home technology and not suitable for the life of Vietnamese people. Especially, they also highlight their concern about current child abduction. Since most people use smart houses because they are too busy with work and their time at home is very little, ensuring the safety of their children is always the biggest obstacle. That is also the main reason why we want to create AI in our project. More specifically for this, we promise to solve these problems effectively if the client allows us to be able to track the location on a watch that helps AI communicate and sense threats. For example, a criminal wants to commit a crime with a child, so they have to find a quiet place to harass the victim. On the contrary, our AI can recognize the owner is in danger and it will continuously send an alarm with a noisy sound that makes criminals know they should run away, not stay there. Besides, we also have a smart air-conditioning system setup to avoid heat shock when walking out of the house. Because the temperature in Vietnam is so hot, getting out of the house in the middle of midday is a heat shock.
</p>
<p> On the other hand, besides the team's ideas and technologies, it is undeniable that we are having big trouble with the experience and understanding of AI and the minimum requirements to make our project. become reality. For instance, when doing the research and development of the project we all based on the information already on the internet and selected it for the best fit but we cannot test it on our product. However, if we have to hand this project over at the end of the semester to a new team to complete the job, we would highly expect that they will start testing them with which technology first for a practical perspective.
</p>
<h3> Roles </h3>
<p>In our project, the specific determination for each position includes 4 main positions that are a data analyst, Technical Designer, Information Security Officer and Programmer:
</p>
<p>Data analyst: A data analyst is responsible for collecting information with a clear analysis that can be applied directly to the project. For instance, they will be the ones to see the right temperature for the air conditioner and the outside temperature at the same time to minimize thermal shock. Furthermore, they must also be technologically savvy to be able to understand what data machines cannot compute on their own to have a solution to that.
</p>
<p>Technical Designer:  For this position need to concretize the basic design after the approved work construction investment project in order to fully demonstrate the solutions, specifications and materials used in accordance with technical standards and regulations. application, as the basis for developing construction drawing design. For instance, they will have to design it to suit each house to ensure all features of the project are technically correct and get the best performance.
</p>
<p>Information Security Officer: in this position is critical to making the project safe or not. They will have to completely eliminate hazards that could directly affect the project and the users of this product. For instance, at this time there are many cases where the camera is stolen and caused great damage to the user and the company of the product. Information protection will be of primary concern as it will be very harmful if the project has poor security.
</p>
<p>Programmer: In this position, experience and proficiency in programming are required. They can apply the project's requirements based on their experience to program them correctly and successfully correct them. For instance, they need to be experienced and competent so that when the project features can be programmed quickly to test it as soon as possible.
</p>
<h3> Scope and Limits </h3>
<p> The project is expecting to create a full functional AI to be remotely controlled and the AI will be commanded or customized by the house owner. However, with the limitation of technology in recent years, creating such an AI is challenging and requires lots of criteria which are quite impossible to obtain now. So our expectation on this project is creating an AI to remotely control by client through a mobile or pc app, the owner now has a chance to control the AI by selecting function show on the app by hands so it is not possible to control the AI by voice recognition or client’s mind. Moreover it is only control the electric devices which are already plugged in although there are tons of non electric devices such as doors, windows or even gas stove . The AI can not distinguish between animals and people and it can only store information rather than using that information to recognize the member of the family or the robbery. The only function is alerting someone is stepping in the house.  </p>
<h3>  Tools and Technologies </h3>
<p> The first software which is extremely essential for creating AI is Azure Machine Learning, this kind of software contains services such as AML workbench, AML experimentation Service, AML model management, MMLSpark ( Microsoft machine learning libraries for apache spark), visual studio used for AI coded. The tools are easily processed for beginners and all the data will be privately secured by Microsoft Azure cloud, some services of the tools are quite familiar with members of the team such as visual studio which we had learned before. However the services used for creating such an AI is still difficult to process as well as approach advanced functions but this is one of the most basic tools for AI so all of the members would be able to get the insight features of the tool.  The second software is used to store the data for second used or backup files called Box Container 3.6, this type of software is quite difficult to members of the team but it is so far the best tool for securing the data. The last software is a mobile or Pc application called Reminder which will be created for the house owner to receive alerts from the main AI, this software will be created on the python or visual studio platform by members of the team. The second and third software do not need a license to access because the team could use the cracked version but for the first one which is an Microsoft software so it is better to buy a key to use all the advanced features. About hardware the only thing we need is a modem to connect the AI with the internet of the house then the AI will take control over the whole place, the modem would look like an Internet modem so it is not so difficult for the team to create it. </p>
<h3> Testing </h3>
<p> The test will happen in 4 stages : virtual testing, prototype testing, real field testing, final test. In the first stage we need to test the software online to know whether all the functions work correctly, we would use the code testing software to run all the code we made for the AI and debug any minor or core issues. Next stage we make a prototype of the product with a simple modem and try to connect it with our Internet modem at our facility, try to use the app and control the house with the prototype, the AI will be used at 4 houses of 4 members of the team in 1 month to realize how it work differently in other Internet access. Next step, we would try the AI at volunteer’s houses in at least 1 month to see what could be the problems so far and how to improve the functions, the volunteer will be collected from a post in our main website and give them a chance to test the AI in the first month and 3 free month for gift, the project need to get as much feedback as possible so the team will try to find at least 20 people to use the AI at their property. The final test is a period of selling product in the first year so if any one try to purchase the AI product in the first year in the market the team would give them a free first 10 day to use the demo function of the device, in the first 10 day if any problem happen we would the client a brand new one and ensure the new one is working correctly as their need. We would discuss the result of any stage of testing and compare all 4 stages with each other, so if the first stage the machine work correctly but it is different with the second stage we would have a discourse and try to figure what cause the different and when should we fix the issues, until all the stage release the same result or better result we would confirm that this AI is ready for selling. </p>

<h3> Group processes and communications </h3>
<p> Because of teamwork, communication is the minimum requirement for the best team development. Our team tried to arrange a time to meet face-to-face to be able to discuss details as well as make plans for weekly plans. We made appointments and met every Monday to have a meeting for at least 30 minutes so we could talk about the project while checking each week's assigned work progress. Besides meeting face to face, we still communicate directly with each other on the Facebook group every day if someone has any good questions as well as helping each other find information. Since everyone will have their own work, we tried to meet once a week but kept in touch. That helps us to control the quality as well as the duration of the work. However, we all understand that not responding to communications will have a huge impact on the project so we communicated with each other regularly and on time.
