<p> <b> • ID: </b> s3824318 </p>
<p> <b> • Email: </b> s3824318@rmit.edu.vn </p>
<p> <b> • Facts: </b> I like IT programming, and study front end back end.
</p>
<p> <b> • IT interest: </b> My brother is the one who inspired me to follow the IT patch. I said that because anytime I saw him on the computer, his fingers  surfed on the keyboard so fast that I couldn't even recognize what he was trying to type. Each line of code he types on the computer makes me wonder what he is going to create with those lines. Suddenly, he shows me that if any spam email or malware wants to enter our PC system, it will immediately remove the harmful material. From that moment, I feel that IT will be my future career where I could develop software that protects others' private information against those hackers who try to steal bank accounts, and customer data. Moreover, I have participated in a robotics coding competition 2 years ago which my team earned second place overall. This powerful experience I gained was really helpful with the major I currently study in Rmit. I have taken one more step closer to become a skillful software developer. Although I still need to put more effort into it, I will try my best.

<li> Based on 3 tests, I found that my creative skill is really helpful for my group because when we discussed about our project ideas, sometimes I suggested a good idea for my team. However, it is still not enough because Cheng’s ideas are always better. However, I need to work on my leading skill because I could not handle things too much and lead my team in a right way. However, I can say that as a Visual learner, I work really well when I understand the functional of something, based on this, I can help my teammate to fix or solve problems.

<h2>Group processes</h2>
<h2>Career Plans</h2>
<p> For us, there is a lot in common when it comes to Ideal Work. Examples: what all knowledge members have in common using IT skills such as coding, experience with all programming languages ​​and soft skills such as communication. Thinh chose to work as an embedded software engineer while others chose to work in different fields such as working for Apple, Software Engineering and Game Creation. An ideal job for entertainment is games, which require difficult areas in the IT industry, and Tuan chose to work in Apple's platform-based development. Beside Cheng choose to become a software engineering which I required to study more coding languages ​​as well as understand deeply about the technology. However, although everyone in the group has different directions, all the ideal jobs of the group have some similarities as we all work with IT systems and PC software, jobs. This requires general skills and job experience that can develop during the job.

 </p>
 <p> On the one hand, the concept part of the project, which everyone on the team thought it would be difficult because the knowledge in this area seemed to be our biggest challenge. We discussed a lot about how to get practical ideas for the smart home project. Our original intention was just a smart home that could be controlled by devices as far away as a phone. But things changed as we learned more about other serious issues such as today's worldwide kidnapping situation.
